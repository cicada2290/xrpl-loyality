accept
Accept the originating transaction and commit any changes the hook made.

Concepts
Introduction
Execution Order
Behaviour
End the execution of the hook with status: success.

Record a return string and return code in transaction metadata.
Commit all state changes.
Submit all emit() transactions.
Allow originating transaction to continue.
ðŸš§
Caution

If the originating transaction is stopped for some other reason then this accept becomes a rollback. See: Execution Order.

Definition
C

int64_t accept (
    uint32_t read_ptr,
    uint32_t read_len,
    uint64_t error_code
);
Example
C

accept("Success", 7, 100);
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
read_ptr	uint32_t	Pointer to a return string to be stored in execution metadata.
This is any string the hook-developer wishes to return with the acceptance. May be null.
read_len	uint32_t	The length of the return string. At most 32. May be null.
error_code	uint64_t	A return code specific to this hook to be stored in execution metadata.

Similar to the return code of an application on a *nix system. By convention success is zero.
Return Code
Type	Description
int64_t	Accept ends the hook, therefore no value is returned to the caller. By convention all Hook APIs return int64_t, but in this case nothing is returned.
